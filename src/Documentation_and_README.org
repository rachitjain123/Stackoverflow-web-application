* README
** Getting Started

- These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

** Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software and instructions to install them:

- You should have python3 and pip3 installed:

- First check if python3 is intstalled by using the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  python3 -V
#+END_SRC

- Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
  Python 3.5.2
#+END_SRC
  
- If not installed then type the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get -y update
#+END_SRC
** Instructions for installing pip

#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

#+END_SRC
** Instructions for installing few more packages and development tools for the programming environment

#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
#+END_SRC
** Installing

- Getting our web app up and running is simple. 
- To run it you have to do what you do with most flask apps.

** Setting up virtual environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 name_of_your_environment
source name_of_your_environment/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC
** Creating the initial database:
#+BEGIN_SRC python 
 python db_create.py
 python db_migrate.py # In case you need to migrate the database
#+END_SRC

** Running the web app :
#+BEGIN_SRC python 
python run.py # The web app can be run in http://127.0.0.1:5000
#+END_SRC

** Deployment

- Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

* Flask
It is a simple web app made using Flask web framework to implement a StackOverflow-like forum site.
- Official *Flask documentation* [[http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/][here]].


* How we started ..
- First we started by building database schema.
- Then we built a blueprint of the application like organised controllers and models in different folders of users, comments, etc.
- Then we started coding controllers and models. First we coded models and controllers of users.
- Then we built base.html which is usd in every HTML page.
- Then we started by building controllers and models for login and register page
- Then we coded controllers and models of comments,answers,tags,etc and side by side coded html.
- Then we made profile page which shows the statastics of the user like number of questions asked,upvotes,downvotes,etc.
- Then we added some integrity check features that is each user can upvote or downvote only once.
- Then we added some more features like Migration and Pagination.
- At last we added some security features like CSRF protection,captcha generation.
- We also implemented a 404 page error in which will be displayed if someone asks for a page which is not in our web app.


* Design
- Used inheritance feature, for eg. every HTML page inherits from base.html.
- Used SQLAlchemy-migrate to keep track of database updates for us-> Migration feature.
- Used Sqlite database.
- Important feature in our web application is there is a unique gravatar for each user which is generated online when the user successfully registers.
- Pagination is also a feature in our app so that six posts per page is visible.
- Used WT forms which helps in rendering fields and which also has built in validators. 
- Integrity check feature -> One user can only upvote or downvote once.
- Every user can view the dashboard of other user and see his/her statastics which shows number of questions answered,questions asked ,upvotes,downvotes.
- A user can add multiple tags to a particular question and can search question by tags
- Factored our web app into a set of blueprints for making application components and supporting common patterns within an application or across applications. 


* Security
- Used SQLALCHEMY prevent SQL injection.
- Used CSRF protction which is auto enabled by WTF forms.
- Another important thing that we had done for security is Captcha generation at the time of registration which the user has to verify.
  A CAPTCHA (a backronym for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart") is a type of challenge-response test 
  used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human.
- The passwords are stored as hashes not in plain taxt,so even if our database is stolen by someone else he/she cannot get the password used for login
  into our web app.
